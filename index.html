      <p>
        Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technology that produces three dimensional detailed anatomical images. It is often used for disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. It is based on sophisticated technology that excites and detects the change in the direction of the rotational axis of protons found in the water that makes up living tissues.

    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        MRIs employ powerful magnets which produce a strong magnetic field that forces protons in the body to align with that field. When a radiofrequency current is then pulsed through the patient, the protons are stimulated, and spin out of equilibrium, straining against the pull of the magnetic field. When the radiofrequency field is turned off, the MRI sensors are able to detect the energy released as the protons realign with the magnetic field. The time it takes for the protons to realign with the magnetic field, as well as the amount of energy released, changes depending on the environment and the chemical nature of the molecules. Physicians are able to tell the difference between various types of tissues based on these magnetic properties.

        MRI scanners are particularly well suited to image the non-bony parts or soft tissues of the body. They differ from computed tomography (CT), in that they do not use the damaging ionizing radiation of x-rays. The brain, spinal cord and nerves, as well as muscles, ligaments, and tendons are seen much more clearly with MRI than with regular x-rays and CT; for this reason MRI is often used to image knee and shoulder injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the brain, MRI can differentiate between white matter and grey matter and can also be used to diagnose aneurysms and tumors. Because MRI does not use x-rays or other radiation, it is the imaging modality of choice when frequent imaging is required for diagnosis or therapy, especially in the brain. However, MRI is more expensive than x-ray imaging or CT scanning.
      </p>
      <p>
        One kind of specialized MRI is functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI.) This is used to observe brain structures and determine which areas of the brain “activate” (consume more oxygen) during various cognitive tasks. It is used to advance the understanding of brain organization and offers a potential new standard for assessing neurological status and neurosurgical risk.

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Definition & Uses" on Study.com: This material introduces the application of infrared spectroscopy in forensic science and homeland security. It mentions that infrared spectroscopy can identify organic compounds such as human body fluids, flammables, and explosives. It is widely used in the identification of inks, sweat prints, hair, fibers, and toxic industrial materials and chemicals. It is also used in arson cases to identify residues of incendiary substances. Moreover, the development of portable Fourier - transform infrared spectroscopy has made on - site analysis possible.

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            on AzoOptics.com: This article states that infrared spectroscopy is widely relied on in many areas of forensics. It can be used to analyze various types of evidence left at crime scenes, such as paint, ink, fuels, and biological traces. It is a non - destructive technique, and the development of portable equipment allows for on - site analysis without disturbing the evidence. It is of great significance in the examination of inks to identify forgeries, the analysis of biological substances such as sweat, the identification of fibers, and the analysis of paint chips.

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Fuel: The fuel used in nuclear reactors is usually uranium - 235 or plutonium - 239. These are fissile materials, meaning their nuclei can be split when struck by a neutron.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chain Reaction: When a neutron hits the nucleus of a uranium - 235 atom, it causes the nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei, along with the release of a few neutrons and a large amount of energy in the form of heat. The newly released neutrons can then go on to strike other uranium - 235 nuclei, starting a chain reaction. This process releases a continuous and controlled amount of energy.

            The high - pressure steam is used to drive a turbine. The turbine is connected to a generator, and as the turbine spins, it generates electricity through electromagnetic induction. After passing through the turbine, the steam is cooled and condensed back into water, which can then be reused in the heat - transfer process.
